      <p id="intro">The Golden Gate Bridge Toll Plaza is rife with contradictions. Despite this seemingly streamlined and automated toll collection, the physical space of the plaza hearkens back to the 1950s in its mid-century architecture and the ever-present, looming eyes of the Toll Plaza Clock that, while still functional, is nevertheless of a vestigial actor of a previous time. <br><br>

The presence of the Toll Plaza Clock shrouds the space in temporal metaphor that suggests the repercussions of political intervention in infrastructure, as evidenced by the George Washington Bridge Scandal supposedly initiated by New Jersey governor Chris Christie. Although the automated tolls are intended to increase efficiency of travel, the toll nevertheless slows down travel, from 45 mph to 25 mph specifically, while also recording Personal Identity Information and requiring money. <br><br>

Such a process is delightfully mirrored on the internet, where words like “traffic,” “delay,” “lag,” and “portal” take on parallel, though nuanced, meanings. Because the Golden Gate Toll Plaza is so entrenched in concepts of a chronological nature, I have created a browser extension that produces the same effect on internet travel that the toll plaza produces on physical travel in the form of link lags and page delays. <br><br>

While such an experience may seem inconvenient (and we certainly view delays as such while traveling on the highways), the extension offers users a new opportunity to slow down in our busy, fast-paced environment where information consumption increases at a faster pace every day. There may be a speed limit on the highway, but there's no speed limit on the internet.
